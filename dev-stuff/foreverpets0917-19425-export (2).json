      "Activity" : "High-​Malamutes are pack animals, and a pack can have just one leader. And in your family “pack,” the leader must be you. If a Mal doesn’t respect you, he’ll wind up owning you instead of the other way around. Firm but loving training should begin in early puppyhood. That said, a well-behaved Malamute is a joy to be with—playful, gentle, friendly, and great with kids. This breed is especially good for families who enjoy outdoor fun like hiking and camping.",

      "Description" : "The largest and oldest of the Arctic sled dogs, the Alaskan Malamute possesses great strength and endurance. He is not designed to race, but rather to carry large loads over long distances. Today, many Malamutes are family pets, but are highly athletic and still capable of enjoying sledding, weight-pulling, back-packing, jogging and swimming with their owners. The Malamute coat is thick and coarse, with a plumed tail carried over the back. The coat usually ranges in color from light gray to black or from sable to red. Face markings, including a cap on the head and a bar/mask on the face are often distinguishing features.",
      "Grooming" : "Adapted for harsh, Arctic life, the Malamute's beautiful waterproof double coat requires regular brushing and bathing to stay healthy. They have thick coats, which shed heavily twice a year. Using a pin brush and a metal-toothed ‘greyhound’ comb for brushing will help keep his coat in good condition and keep seasonal shedding more manageable. Be sure to brush him daily and check for mats which can hide fungus and hot spots which may become infected. Thick nails require regular trimming with a nail clipper or grinder. Check ears weekly for accumulated dirt, wax or other foreign matter that may result in an infection. Teeth should be brushed regularly.",
      "History" : "The Alaskan Malamute is believed to be a descendant of the domesticated wolf-dogs who accompanied the Paleolithic hunters who crossed the land bridges of the Bering Strait and and migrated into the North American continent roughly 4,000 years ago. Paul Voelker, an early Malamute breeder and trainer, maintained that the breed was probably the first dog to be associated with man.

Although cute and cuddly-looking, a French Bulldog has a big personality and needs an adequate amount of training to make it a civilized companion.

      "Activity" : "Medium - Nicknamed the “tomboy toy,” Yorkies are bundles of energy and enthusiasm. They get along well with other dogs, but can be loners, choosing to investigate sights, sounds, and smells over romping around at the park. Yorkies are incredibly loyal to their owners and prefer to stay close by their side—but don’t mistake this for a need to be pampered. Their tendency to bark makes them reliable watchdogs, and their gentle nature makes them a good fit for families with children.",

      "Description" : "\"Yorkshire Terriers, affectionately known as \"Yorkies,\" offer big personalities in a small package. Though members of the Toy Group, they are terriers by nature and are brave, determined, investigative and energetic. Named for the English county from which they originally hail, Yorkshire Terriers were used in the nineteenth century to catch rats in clothing mills. Surprisingly enough, in its beginnings, the Yorkie belonged to the working class, especially the weavers; in fact, facetious comments were often made about how the dogs' fine, silky coats were the ultimate product of the looms. Eventually, the breed left the workforce and became a companion animal to families of European high society.\"",

The Waterside Terrier was a breed formed by the crossing of the old rough-coated Black-and-Tan English Terrier (common in the Manchester area) and the Paisley and Clydesdale Terriers.
