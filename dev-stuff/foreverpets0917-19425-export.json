      "Grooming" : "As a double-coated breed, they also tend to shed, and so require regular brushing. Their gentle, easygoing manner and the need to be close to their people makes them a good fit for families. Using a good pin brush and slicker will make grooming a Berner an easy task to remove mats and tangles. This frequent brushing and the occasional bath will keep their coat in good condition. Their nails should be trimmed regularly to avoid overgrowth and cracking. Their ears should be checked regularly to avoid a buildup of wax and debris which can result in an infection. Teeth should be brushed regularly.",

      "Description" : "A well-conditioned Boxer is an awesome sight. A male can stand as high as 25 inches at the shoulder, females a little shorter. Their muscles ripple beneath their short, tight-fitting coat. The dark brown eyes and wrinkled forehead give the face an alert, curious look. Boxers move like the athletes they’re named for: smooth and graceful, but powerful. The coat can be fawn (tan to mahogany-red) or brindle (kind of like tiger stripes), with white markings.",
      "Grooming" : "A soft bristle brush will help keep the coat in good condition. An occasional bath, especially if they are dirty from romping in the outdoors will also keep them looking their best. Their strong nails should be trimmed regularly with a nail clipper or grinder to avoid overgrowth, splitting and cracking. Their ears should be checked regularly to avoid a buildup of wax and debris which can result in an infection. Teeth should be brushed regularly.",
      "History" : "Although it has reached its greatest perfection in Germany during the past hundred years, the Boxer springs from a line of dogs known throughout the whole of Europe since the 16th century. Prior to that time, ancestors of the breed would hardly be recognized as Boxers could they be placed beside modern specimens. Still, evidence points to the Boxer as one of the many descendants of the old fighting dog of the high valleys of Tibet.",

      "Activity" : "low - You won’t have to worry about a yappy dog bothering your neighbors because Frenchies rarely bark. That said, you can count on them to alert their owners to danger (Look! The UPS guy is coming!). They enjoy daily walks or brief outdoor romps, but because of their short noses, they shouldn’t be exercised on hot, humid days and should have access to cool (preferably air-conditioned) rooms during the warmer months. Besides snoozing the day away, the Frenchie’s favorite hobby is being his owner’s personal lap warmer.",

      "Grooming" : "Routine grooming for the French Bulldog includes regular nail trimming, ear cleaning, brushing to remove excess hair, frequent cleansing of skin folds, and occasional bathing.

Their bat ears should be checked regularly to avoid a buildup of wax and debris which can result in an infection. Teeth should be brushed regularly.",

Many dog food companies have breed-specific formulas for small, medium, large and giant breeds. The French Bulldog is a small breed and has a lifespan of 11 to 13 years.What you feed your dog is an individual choice, but working with your veterinarian and/or breeder will be the best way to determine frequency of meals as a puppy and the best adult diet to increase his longevity. Clean, fresh water should be available at all times.",
      "Size" : "Small (under 28 pounds)",
      "Temperment" : "While good at alerting their owners to danger, their main role is that of lap warmer. The Frenchie requires minimal exercise. A crate trained puppy is easier to housebreak. A dog regards its crate as its den, a safe haven and home. If you travel, the dog is safest in his crate in your vehicle and also when you stay in hotels or visit other people. If he should be ill or injured and need to be kept quiet, this is much easier if he is happy in a crate. In warm areas, cooling pads and fresh water should be placed in the crate too. You should take your French Bulldog to training classes as soon as your veterinarian feels he has proper immunity. This will get him accustomed to being around other dogs and people, will teach you how to communicate your wishes to him, and will teach him such basics as walking well on a lead, sitting, staying, and coming on command. Although cute and cuddly-looking, a French Bulldog has a big personality and needs an adequate amount of training to make it a civilized companion. Contrary to the stereotype as “stubborn”, most Frenchies strive to please their owners and are therefore very trainable with the proper motivation (usually food)."
